- I’m @ceskim
- Mainly a graphics person. A lot of my work was done under massive pressure from Hack-A-Thons, so don't expect anything incredibly polished or perfect. I'll rip out some case studies in the near future.
- How to reach me: [skim#0615](discord.com/users/837932842574282752) or seeukim@proton.me
